# GSA-TTS Astro USWDS Starter Template

This is a variation of the Astro `create-astro` template using U.S. Web Design System v3.0 (USWDS), focused on providing developers a starter template and reference implementation for Cloud.gov Pages websites.

This project strives to be compliant with requirements set by 21st Century IDEA Act. The standards require that a website or digital service:

- is accessible to individuals with disabilities;
- has a consistent appearance;
- does not duplicate any legacy websites (the legislation also requires agencies to ensure that legacy websites are regularly reviewed, removed, and consolidated);
- has a search function;
- uses an industry standard secure connection;
- “is designed around user needs with data-driven analysis influencing management and development decisions, using qualitative and quantitative data to determine user goals, needs, and behaviors, and continually test the website, web-based form, web-based application, or digital service to ensure that user needs are addressed;”
allows for user customization; and
is mobile-friendly.
